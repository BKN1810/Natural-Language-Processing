       " 'Later, more complex image processing was performed on the nearly 100,000 photos sent back by the spacecraft, so that the topographic map, color map and panoramic mosaic of the moon were obtained, which achieved extraordinary results and laid a solid foundation for human landing on the moon.',\n",

      "As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing.  In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. In image processing, the input is a low-quality image, and the out put is an image with improved quality. Common image processing include image enhancement, restoration, encoding, and compression. The purpose of early image processing was to improve the quality of the image. DSP chips have since been widely used in digital image processing. Westworld (1973) was the first feature film to use the digital image processing to pixellate photography to simulate an android's point of view.\n"
